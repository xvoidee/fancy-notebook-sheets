## What is it?
Generators for various notebook sheets:
* millimeters
* dots

Useful for writing, sheets help with text/drawings positioning and save your money by not buying expensive notebooks from a shop.
## How to use
Install dependencies
```
sudo apt install python3-reportlab
```
Run generator
```
python3 millimeter.py
python3 dots.py
```
After that just print your fancy PDFs with B/W settings (I tested it on Brother laser printer only)
